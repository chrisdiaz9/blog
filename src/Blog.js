            The unmotivated only work when they're inspired. The determined push
            themselves even when motivation is low. But the exceptional? They
            find a way to stay inspired, no matter what. To stay inspired one
            must cultivate a passion for life itself. Continually observe the
            things around you and question how they came to be. Anything can be
            used as a source of inspiration. Just look around. Become excited
            about lifeâ€™s infinite beauty.
