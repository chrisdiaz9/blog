          I'm Chris, and probably just like you, I have a goal I'm working
          towards. Mine is to achieve personal and financial independence. If
          you think I'm cool I assure you I'm not. I'm only 20 years old and
          I've already failed at 10+ projects. And to be real, I haven't
          succeeded once. The idea of this blog is to document my journey. Each
          project I work on will be documented here. I'll also write essays here
          expressing my thoughts and ideas. This is my journey presented to you,
          I hope you stick along and enjoy!
